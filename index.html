        <h2>What is our purpose?</h2>
        <p class="inceput">In the heart of our ONG, the journey of cat adoptions represents the pinnacle of our efforts. It's the moment
            when a once-overlooked paw finds its forever home, and a new chapter begins. Through tireless rescue
            missions, compassionate rehabilitation, and unwavering advocacy, we pave the way for these feline companions
            to embark on a life filled with love, warmth, and companionship. In embracing cat adoptions, we not only
            transform the lives of our feline friends but also enrich the lives of those who open their hearts and
            homes. </p>

                            regain their physical health. For traumatized or abused cats, the organization employs
                            specialized rehabilitation programs that focus on building trust and confidence. These
                            programs often involve positive reinforcement, socialization with other cats, and
